    - name: "**[Why we have a Pre-SICSS Period?](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2021/materials/istanbul/Pre-SICSS%20Tasks/Introduction.md)**<br/>This 2-week pre-SICSS period will feature a number of essential computational social science readings, along with programming foundation modules to bridge everyone’s diverse skill set. Even if you have excellent programming skills, please go along with us through this period, so that when the actual SICSS begins, you’ll already have a good sense of common problems and skill sets, so that you can get an understanding of who to partner with during the second week of SICSS, where groups will come up with their own research questions and work on it for an entire week."
    - name: "**[What are Pre-SICSS Tasks?](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/tree/master/2021/materials/istanbul/Pre-SICSS%20Tasks)**<br/>Pre-SICSS tasks provide you with practical experience of [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp/), Day 2 (Collecting Digital Trace Data), and Day 3(Automated Text Analysis) of [SICSS Lecture Materials](https://sicss.io/curriculum). We extended Day 2 and 3 exercises and provided more time to finish them individually (or in a group setting), considering different learning curves in our cohort. We believe that learning to code is a unique process for everyone. However, some would see a benefit in solving tasks in a group setting. Therefore, we are leaving the decision of doing our tasks individually or in a group setting to you."
    - name: "**[What are Code Walkthrough Sessions?](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/tree/master/2021/materials/istanbul/Replication%20Codes)**<br/> While working on Pre-SICSS tasks, coding walkthrough sessions will be held on our tasks. Thus, participants will have a chance to replicate the codes on their desks to improve their coding experience."

We already covered some of the SICSS curriculum during Pre-SICSS period. By completing Pre-SICSS tasks, you had a hands-on-experience on how to collect data from the web and how to process your data. We will have small group discussions on Ethics first. Then, we will host eminent scholars of computational social science to see not only state-of-the-art methods in the field but also applications of those methods in multiple disciplines. Some of the talks have premilinary readings. Having look at those readings will be benefit of you to follow the talk. You will also have research dating sessions to establish your group for the second week program and you are expected to report your group members and a short description of your group project at the end of the week."

Therefore, we will organize an industry talk with an eminent figure in Turkish innovation industry to see other side of the coin. We will also host an eminent figure of Turkish Natural Language Processing to learn the state-of-the-art NLP applications in social sciences. Additionally, we will have an alumni talk to discuss on an ongoing research started at the last year of SICSS."
