  bio: Nicole Han is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at UCSB. Her main research interest lies in understanding the mechanisms, both shared and distinct, that humans and machines use to perform visual tasks. She has worked on investigating the degree to which different facial features contribute to the guidance of the first (and most critical) eye movements onto faces. She utilized deep-learning techniques to improve the quality of visual prostheses with limited resolutions. Her dissertation topic is aiming to understand how our perception of another person's direction of gaze affects where and what we attend to in real-world environments. In addition, she is working on training computer vision models to understand human visual attention (gaze direction). In general, she is interested in combining measurements of human behavior (psychophysics, eye tracking), computational neuroscience, and machine learning techniques to identify the neural, cognitive, and perceptual mechanisms underlying critical visual tasks.
