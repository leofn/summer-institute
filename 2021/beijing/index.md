From Monday, June 14 to Friday, June 25, 2021, the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, Beijing site will be virtually held. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, reading group seminars, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. A site-specific focus at this partner institute will be 
**network science**. Topics covered include (but are not limited to): 

* Network science models, including but not limited to physical, economic, and statistical models; 
* Methods that approach network data, including but not limited to including statistics, machine learning, and causal inference; 
* Applications of network science to the social sciences (broadly conceived).

There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. In reading group seminars, participants will share cutting-edge works involving network methods from their disciplines. We expect participants to build teams with their fellow participants to generate working projects during this two-week event. These projects might receive funding support from the Institute. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculties across the globe. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program.

To ensure full consideration, please submit your [Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2021/beijing/apply) by ~~April 1, 2021~~ April 7, 2021. You can still submit your application after the deadline, but full consideration will not be guaranteed.

Participation is free of charge.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all events will take place online.
