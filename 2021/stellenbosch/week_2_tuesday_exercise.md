# SICSS Group Exercise Week 2, Day 2

 ## Collecting Digital Trace Data

 Today the videos covered a broad range of topics including screen-scraping, working with APIs, and building apps and bots for social science research. Some of you may have already had experience with some or even most of these issuesâ€“ but for others, this may have been your first time collecting digital trace data. This exercise is designed to find a balance between practicing rudimentary skills (for those of you with little or no experience in this area) to cutting edge techniques (for those of you with extensive expertise in this area). As an added bonus, this exercise not only challenges you to practice your coding skills, but to think about how to ask questions that contribute new knowledge to social science theory as well.

- First, identify a research question that you believe can be answered using some of the methods discussed in today's videos. As an example, you might have a research question about covid statistics or discussions on Twitter related to the pandemic.
- Identify a sampling frame to help you answer this research question. For example, if your question is about the Coronavirus pandemic, your sampling frame might be a table on the [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) website, or tweets containing the keywords "coronavirus";
- Use (legal) screen-scraping techniques in order to collect data from websites that record total Corona virus cases per country, amount of tests performed and population, etc.
- Write code to collect tweets using the Twitter API regarding the discussion being held around the pandemic that you could compare to the data you collected previously. 
- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the data you have collected
- Use the fields in your data to do some prelimiary data analysis. For example, see if you can create a bar plot that shows the number of tweets per language. Or plot the number of cases for the top 10 countries for Covid-19 cases. Preliminary data analysis shortly after collection helps to quickly show if there are any errors in your data collection. 
- What other data could you collect?

Share the results of your work on slack.
