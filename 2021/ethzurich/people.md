## Participants

### Ajagbe, Samson
Samson is a research associate in a project on West African English on the Move at the English Department of the University of Freiburg, and an Adjunct lecturer at the Catholic University of Applied Sciences, Freiburg, where he teaches social and educational work with refugees. Samson’s work on migration and language study inspired his current research on the relationship between language and forms of discrimination. His research concentration straddles his current interest in studying language and discrimination and his previous research on democratization study. Samson received a PhD in Sociology at the University of Freiburg, and he is keen on applying natural language processing in the study of language and discrimination.

### Levy, Samuel

I am a PhD candidate in the Environmental Policy Lab at ETH Zürich with an interdisciplinary background, having previously studied social anthropology, geography and environmental science. My research investigates the relationship between land use, livelihoods and global supply chains, with a specific focus on the effectiveness and equity of zero deforestation initiatives in the cattle sector of the Brazilian Amazon. To understand these issues, I primarily use econometric and network analysis approaches to analyse data that is either remotely sensed or collected from the field. However, I am increasingly drawn towards data science techniques, such as web scraping and machine learning and am excited to learn more through the SICSS!
