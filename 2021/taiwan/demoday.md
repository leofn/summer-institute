## About SICSS-Taiwan 
SICSS-Taiwan is a two-week intensive event for junior faculty, post-docs and graduate students in the fields of social science and data science. 
The first week is core SICSS curriculum based on flipped-classroom learning model. During the second week, similar to a multiple-day research-oriented hackathon, participants embarked on a project idea.
