# Small group discussion guide
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2021
## Day 1, Small group discussions
## Prepared by Megan Kang and Matt Salganik

### Summary

In this activity, participants will split into small groups and discuss computational social science and SICSS.

### Learning objectives

- Participants will get a chance to get to know each other on the first day.
- Participants will develop their own views on computational social science as a field.

### Participant preparation

There is no participant preparation before this activity.

### Activity

- We will split you into small groups of about 4 people.
- Introduce yourself to each other and discuss prompt 1 (about 20 minutes): One of the videos you watched before participating featured Matt answering the question "What is computational social science?".  But, that's just his view.  What do you think is computational social science?  What are the things that are most exciting about computational social science to you? Are there specific computational social science studies that you find particularly beautiful or inspiring?
- Discuss prompt 2 (about 20 minutes): One of the videos you watched before participating featured Chris talking about why we think SICSS is important. What do you hope to get out of SICSS? What would make our time together more successful?
- Full group discussion (about 20 minutes).
