# Small group discussion guide
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2021
## Day 1, Small group discussions
## Prepared by Robin Lee

### Summary

In this activity, participants will split into small groups and discuss computational social science and SICSS.

### Learning objectives

- Participants will get a chance to get to know each other on the first day.
- Participants will develop their own views on computational social science as a field.
- Participants will get to recap their learnings regarding introduction materials.

### Participant preparation

There is no participant preparation before this activity.

### Activity

- We will split you into small groups of about 4 people.
- Introduce yourself to each other and discuss one topic from session 1 the group is most interested in (about 15 minutes)

- Full group discussion on session 1 (about 10 minutes).
- Discuss one topic from session 2 (about 15 minutes)
- Full group discussion on session 2 (about 10 minutes).

### Session 1 Topics

1. One of the videos you watched before participating featured Matt answering the question "What is computational social science?".  But, that's just his view.  What do you think is computational social science?  What are the things that are most exciting about computational social science to you? Are there specific computational social science studies that you find particularly beautiful or inspiring?

2. How accessible do you think Computational Social Science is? What are potential ways for you to expand the audience? Please brainstorm at least 2 potential initiatives.

3. What are some examples of high quality training in either CSS or another interdisciplinary topic that you have participated in? What are the features of those training materials and sessions? Share with your small group members. 


### Session 2 Topics

1. Using mobile phone call records as a data source, please come up with at least 5 potential research questions that it might serve as a useful alternative/complementary dataset. What topics might we answer using this type of data?

2. Let’s say you’re teaching a course for college students, how would you explain the research done by Blumenstock? Please be creative in using visual displays (for example slides, memes, 懶人包).

3. As explained in both video and textbook, doing gold-standard health and demographic surveys is expensive and infrequent. Please come up with 3 existing research-grade, custom-made dataset where cost is a problem and ready-made data using computational methods might serve as a decent proxy?

### Notetaker/facilitator

In session 1, the person with the most strokes in their Chinese name will be the notetaker, while the person with the least strokes will facilitate the conversation. 

In session 2, the persons who have not been notetakers or facilitators should take on the roles.
