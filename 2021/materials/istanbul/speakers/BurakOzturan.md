## COVID-19 Twitter Database: Turkish Sample

With the increase in the time spent at home, social media platforms role in the public discussion have become an integral part of the public discussion in the COVID-19 period. Individuals use those platforms to express their emotions, interact with one another, and engage in political discourse. Therefore, it is essential to analyze social media platforms for those who desire to understand public opinion during the pandemic. This paper is the first study that examines the Turkish Twitter sphere to understand the change in public opinion during the COVID-19 outbreak. For that purpose, starting from the 12th of February, 2020  (one month before the first announced coronavirus cases in Turkey), 4.3 million Turkish tweets with a broad range of keywords are collected until June 2020 in order to investigate the public opinion change in different topics and to examine the actors leading to that change. The scope of the analysis is not only health-related discussion, but also includes a broader range of themes such as politics, economy, and disinformation. Preliminary results suggest that (i) religion is the prominent phenomenon for Turkish people's perception of the pandemic, (ii) and the Turkish Twitter-sphere is highly vulnerable to mis/disinformation operations by social bots.
