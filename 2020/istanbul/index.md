**Update: Because of COVID-19, SICSS-Istanbul will be switched from an in-person event to a virtual event.**

From the afternoon of Sunday, May 31 to the afternoon of Friday, June 26, 2020, Kadir Has University will host a virtual partner event of Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. In addition to the SICSS core sponsors, SICSS-Istanbul is sponsored by Kadir Has University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). The co-organizers and faculty of SICSS-Istanbul are Matti Nelimarkka and Akin Unver.

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Kadir Has University provides free dormitory accommodation for overseas participants and travel costs will be reimbursed up to a set cap. This cap will be determined based on the needs of the admitted class and the budget limitations of the site. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.
