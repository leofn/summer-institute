### Using images and video data for social science: Challenges and opportunities

__Time:__ Tuesday, June 22, 2021. 11am-12pm EDT

__Speakers:__ [Bryce Dietrich](http://www.brycejdietrich.com/index.html) (Assistant Professor of Social Science Informatics at the University of Iowa), [Laura Nelson](http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/blog-page.html) (Assistant Professor of Sociology at Northeastern University), [Michelle Torres](http://smtorres.org/) (Assistant Professor of Political Science at Rice), and [Han Zhang](https://hanzhang.xyz/) (SICSS-Hong Kong 21; Assistant Professor in Division of Social Science at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)

__Moderator:__ [Thomas Davidson](https://www.thomasrdavidson.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 19; Assistant Professor of Sociology at Rutgers University)

__Description:__ Social life is increasingly mediated through images and video and recent advances in machine learning make it possible to analyze these data at scale. It has become commonplace for computational social scientists to work with text and other complex, unstructured data, but we are only just seeing work that uses computational methods to study images and video. This panel focuses on this innovative area of research, exploring how scholars are using such data in cutting-edge research and the technical and ethical challenges involved in such analyses.

### Introduction to Text Analysis in Python: A Hands-on Tutorial

__Time:__ Tuesday, June 22, 2021. 1pm-2pm EDT

__Speaker:__ [Austin van Loon](https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/austin-van-loon) (SICSS-Princeton 19; Ph.D. student in Sociology at Stanford University)

__Description:__ The increased availability of machine-readable text provides a unique opportunity for social scientists, granting us unprecedented access to many aspects of both historical and contemporary social life. This tutorial aims to introduce researchers to text analysis in Python, an open-source programming language. Specifically, I’ll seek to cover: using the new Twitter API v2, pre-processing text, visualizing patterns in data, and a few conceptually accessible methods for quantitatively analyzing unigram frequencies (the “dictionary method” and differential language analysis). The tutorial is divided between a publicly available Google Colab notebook (see below) which provides documented, step-by-step example code, and a live session in which I review key points from the notebook and discuss the methods explored therein more analytically.

### Tutorial on deep learning for causal inference

__Time:__ Thursday, June 24, 2021. 11am-12:30pm EDT

__Speakers:__ [Bernard Koch](https://soc.ucla.edu/grads/bernard-koch) (SICSS-Los Angeles 19, 20, 21;  Ph.D. student in Sociology at UCLA)

__Description:__ This tutorial will teach participants how to build simple deep learning models for causal inference. Although this literature is still quite young, neural networks have the potential to extend causal inference to new settings where confounding is high-dimensional, non-linear, time-varying or even encoded in text, images, and networks. The tutorial will begin with 30 minutes of discussion on what deep learning is and how deep learning can be used for adjustment in observational causal inference, followed by 40 minutes of instruction on how to build your own custom deep learning models in Tensorflow 2. No prior knowledge of Tensorflow or neural networks is necessary, so this is also a great opportunity if you just want to get your feet wet with deep learning for the first time.

__Expected background and computing environment:__ This is an advanced tutorial. Participants will need (at least two of): a basic understanding of causal inference, a basic understanding of supervised machine learning, and intermediate to advanced proficiency in some programming language to get the most out of it. No prior knowledge of deep learning is expected. The tutorial will be taught in Python, but the Tensorflow port for R is very, very similar so ideas will transfer.  The tutorial will be taught in Colaboratory, an interactive notebook environment provided by Google. When you start a Colab session, Google provides you a virtual machine with a GPU, making it a great environment to get started with deep learning. Participants won't need to install anything on their computer, but they will need a gmail or Google hosted email account to use Colab.

__Materials:__ [Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z4lm419eKPEwS6KltSmBs8qMtEnPf7Rl?usp=sharing); [More tutorials on deep learning for causal inference](https://github.com/kochbj/Deep-Learning-for-Causal-Inference)

### Taking Quantitative Description Seriously

__Time:__ Thursday, June 24, 2021. 1-2pm EDT

__Speakers:__ [Andy Guess](https://politics.princeton.edu/people/andrew-m-guess) (Assistant Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton), [Eszter Hargittai](http://www.eszter.com/) (Professor of Communication and Media Research at the University of Zurich), and [Jen Pan](http://jenpan.com/) (Assistant Professor of Communication, Political Science and Sociology at Stanford University)

__Moderator:__ [Kevin Munger](https://polisci.la.psu.edu/people/kmm7999) (SICSS-Princeton 19; Assistant Professor of Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State)

__Description:__ We introduce the rationale for a new peer-reviewed scholarly journal, the [Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media](https://journalqd.org/). The journal is intended to create a new venue for research on digital media and address several deficiencies in the current social science publishing landscape. First, descriptive research is undersupplied and undervalued. Second, research questions too often only reflect dominant theories and received  wisdom. Third, journals are constrained by unnecessary boundaries defined by discipline, geography, and length. Fourth, peer review is inefficient and unnecessarily burdensome for both referees and authors. We outline the journal’s scope and structure, which is open access, fee-free and relies on a Letter of Inquiry (LOI) model. Quantitative description can appeal to social scientists of all stripes and is a crucial methodology for understanding the continuing evolution of digital media and its relationship to important questions of interest to computational social scientists.

### Creating your own virtual lab experiment with Empirica

__Time:__ Friday, June 25, 2021. 9am-1pm EDT

__Speakers:__ [Abdullah Almaatouq](http://www.amaatouq.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17; MIT Sloan, Empirica founder & developer), [Joshua Becker](https://www.joshua-becker.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Chicago 18, SICSS-London 21; UCL School of Management, tutorial author), and [Sam Dupret](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/people/samueldupret) (UCL School of Management, tutorial author)

__Description:__ This is a self-guided, do-it-yourself workshop that will enable you to create virtual lab experiments with [Empirica](https://empirica.ly/).  Empirica is an open-source framework that makes creating virtual lab experiments more fun and less painful.  During this event, participants will first watch a set of [introductory videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPQelvUwyVgiawBDk3Sp74QMfL8RPgORW) (about 10 mins) that provide a conceptual overview.  Participants will then proceed through a [written tutorial](https://docs.empirica.ly/guides/tutorial-your-first-experiment) that will walk them step-by-step through building a multi-player experiment with chatrooms and automated bots.  Upon completing the tutorial, participants will have created an experiment that they can further customize and that is ready to deploy to real research participants.  Faculty members with extensive experience using Empirica for research—and other workshop participants—will be available in the Empirica Slack during the workshop period to help participants through the tutorial and answer more general questions, both about Empirica and related topics like subject recruitment.  Outside the workshop period, the Empirica Slack remains available for general discussion and questions both with the faculty and other community members.

__Expected programming background:__ Empirica is a platform built on ReactJS, but participants do not need to know javascript to complete the tutorial. The tutorial is designed to be self-sufficient for anyone with strong coding skills who can learn on the go.  Knowledge of basic HTML is helpful.  

__Expected computing environment:__ While Empirica can run on Windows, we strongly recommend a Linux/MacOS terminal for ease-of-use and these will be made available upon request.

### Measuring cultural change in digital trace data using diversification rates

__Time:__ Tuesday, June 23, 2020. 1-2 EDT.

__Speaker:__ [Bernard Koch](https://soc.ucla.edu/grads/bernard-koch) (SICSS-Los Angeles 19, 20)

__Description:__ How do we measure cultural change? Through the birth and death of “cultural lineages” (e.g., hashtags, consumer goods, or musical artists), digital trace data allows us to observe cultural change at population scale over time. This tutorial introduces a statistical framework to identify and explain culturally important historical events through changes in the diversity of cultural lineages over time. Users will learn how to run an unsupervised machine learning model called ___LiteRate___ to identify statistically significant shifts in cultural diversity, as well as more restricted models to test theoretical hypotheses about the causes of these events. The tutorial will be accessible to a broad audience.

__Open to:__ Unlimited registered participants: Registration has closed.

__Archiving:__ This talk will not be archived.

### Discussion on diversity in computational social science

__Time:__ Tuesday, June 23, 2020. 3:30-4:30pm EDT

__Host:__ [Matthew Salganik](https://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, 19, SICSS-Duke 18, 20)

__Description:__ In order to thrive, the field of computational social science needs contributions from diverse scholars. This discussion will address this broad challenge in a specific setting: the creation of SICSS-Howard/Mathematica (links to [website](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/howard-mathematica/), form to join the [email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfD7YNUdhhngu4glivO2CAzKX1ief6p2Yyj2B49cdwgk-qwCA/viewform?usp=sf_link), and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SICSS.Howard.Mathematica)), the first SICSS located at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU). Although this site has been postponed until 2021 due to COVID-19, it still serves as a useful case study for discussion. The discussion will focus on efforts to increase diversity in computational social science, why this work is important, and what should be done in the future. There will also be time for the audience to submit written questions to be asked by the host.

### What Can the SICSS Community Do to Recognize and Eradicate Anti-Black Racism in Computational Social Science?

__Time:__ Thursday, June 25. 2-3 PM EDT

__Organizers:__ [Tina Law](https://tinalaw1.github.io/) (SICSS-Duke 18, SICSS-Chicago 19) and [Taylor W. Brown](https://www.taylorwhittenbrown.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Duke 18, SICSS-Oxford 19)

__Description:__ Right now, protests are taking place around the world in response to the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks, and countless other Black lives, and many necessary conversations are being had about anti-Black racism. As members of the SICSS community, what can we do to recognize and eradicate anti-Black racism in our own field? Computational social science is a relatively new field with a lot of potential for positive social change. It is also a field born out of two long-standing disciplines--computer science and social science--that have histories of marginalizing Black scholarship and contributing to anti-Black policies and programs. What are the opportunities and challenges that we face as computational social scientists when it comes to addressing anti-Black racism? And, how can the SICSS community leverage our unique strength as a global network of teachers and scholars to combat anti-Black racism? This discussion and planning session is open to SICSS participants and alumni who are interested in actively tackling these questions together.

__Open to:__ SICSS participants and alumni. Unlimited number of registered participants. Registration has closed.

__Format:__ Discussion & planning session; note that this is not a panel, active participation is encouraged.

### Using Empirica for high-throughput virtual lab experiments (Session 2)

__Time:__ Friday, June 26, 2020. 10-11:30am EDT.

__Speakers:__ [Abdullah Almaatouq](http://www.amaatouq.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17), [Joshua Becker](https://www.joshua-becker.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Chicago 18), [James Houghton](http://www.jamesphoughton.com/) (SICSS-Duke 20), and Nicolas Paton.

__Description:__ [Empirica](https://empirica.ly/) is a new open source software platform for developing and conducting synchronous and interactive human-subject experiments.  It has already been used by researchers around the world. This session will start with a live demonstration where participants will take part in a real-time experiment involving dozens of people.  Next, the data from that experiment will be downloaded and analyzed.  Thus, participants will have a behind-the-scenes, end-to-end experience with an experiment run with Emprica. Finally, there will be time for questions and discussion about Empirica and the future of experiments in the social sciences.

__Open to:__ 30 registered participants. Registration has closed.

__Preparatory materials:__ All registered participants are strongly encouraged to work through and watch [Empirica videos A - E](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPQelvUwyVgiawBDk3Sp74QMfL8RPgORW), which will require them to [install software](https://empirica.ly/docs/quick-start.html) on their computers.
